## Automation

Runs entirely on GitHub's infrastructure via two scheduled workflows:

| Workflow | Schedule | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| [Weekly Screener — US](.github/workflows/weekly_us.yml) | Monday 8am EST | `dashboard.py` → `weekly_snapshot.py` → `screener.py` → `aligned_screener.py` |
| [Weekly Screener — India](.github/workflows/weekly_india.yml) | Monday 8am IST | `india_dashboard.py` → `india_weekly_snapshot.py` → `india_screener.py` → `india_aligned_screener.py` |

Each workflow checks out the repo, installs `yfinance`, runs the scripts, and commits the updated HTML and markdown files back — fully automated, zero manual steps.

You can also trigger either workflow manually anytime from the **Actions** tab on GitHub.

`run_aligned.sh` is available as a local fallback if you want to run everything on your own machine:

```bash
bash run_aligned.sh
# log output → /tmp/aligned_cron.log
```

## Weekly Alignment Framework

`aligned_screener.py` scans the quality universe every week across six signals:

| Signal | What it means |
|---|---|
| **4/4 MA aligned** | Price above 10w, 20w, 10m (43w), 20m (87w) SMAs — full structure intact |
| **FullCoil squeeze** | 10w/20w/35w/50w spread compressed — energy building, potential move ahead |
| **CMF (Chaikin Money Flow)** | Volume weighted to close position in range — accumulation vs distribution (20-week) |
| **RS vs SPY / NIFTY** | 13-week price ratio vs benchmark — outperforming or lagging the market |
| **A/D Line** | Cumulative money flow — 13-week slope rising = institutions accumulating regardless of price action |
| **OBV (On Balance Volume)** | Volume conviction — more volume on up days vs down days over 13 weeks |

**Divergence signals** — `◆bull` = A/D Line rising while price is weak (smart money accumulating before price confirms). `◇bear` = A/D falling while price rises (distribution into strength).

**Confluence progression:**

| Pattern | Reading |
|---|---|
| `⚠ + AD:↓ OBV:↓` | Pure distribution — avoid |
| `⚠ + AD:↑ OBV:↑ ◆` | Early accumulation inside distribution — watch closely |
| `◎ + AD:↓ OBV:↑` | Monthly regime turned, weekly volume confirming |
| `◎ + AD:↑ OBV:↑` | Full confluence — strongest setup |

**Special Mention** — names where price has dislocated far from MAs but structure is quietly rebuilding. Not actionable yet. Monthly CMF trend + A/D Line + OBV tracked together for base-building thesis.

**Pullback Watch** — A+/A quality names at exactly 2/4 MA, -10% to -28% from highs. Long-term structure (10m/20m) intact, short-term MAs broken. Different from Special Mention: weeks away from reclaiming, not months. Watch 20w MA as the first gate back to 3/4.

**Philosophy:** medium and long-term orientation. The framework is not built for scalping or short-term noise. Quality names in full MA alignment with tight coils and accumulation signals — hold the structure, wait for the move.

## MA Proximity Scanner

`ma_scanner.py` (US) and `ma_scanner_india.py` (India / NSE) scan the quality universe for names where price is close to a rising MA10 — but only after confirming the higher timeframe structure is intact. The key principle: **higher timeframe alignment gates lower timeframe signals.** Checking 1H when the weekly is broken is noise, not signal.

### Timeframe hierarchy

```
Weekly  → MA10 > MA20, slope rising       (mandatory gate — no band check)
Daily   → MA10 > MA20, price in band      (first actionable signal)
4H      → MA10 > MA20, price in band      (only if Daily passes)
1H      → MA10 > MA20, price in band      (only if 4H passes)
```

If the weekly is not aligned, the ticker is skipped entirely. If the daily is not in setup, 4H and 1H are not evaluated. Each level must hold before the next one is checked.

### Signal levels

| Signal | What it means |
|---|---|
| `D+4H+1H` | Full waterfall — all three tradeable TFs aligned under a confirmed weekly. Strongest. |
| `D+4H` | Daily + 4H aligned, 1H not yet in band. Structure is there, waiting for 1H confirmation. |
| `D` | Daily aligned under weekly, 4H not yet confirming. Earlier stage. |

### Band — ▲ vs ▽

Price within **-3% to +3% of MA10**:
- `▲` — price above MA10 (confirmed, not extended)
- `▽` — price approaching MA10 from below (early signal — MA alignment still intact, price pulling back into MA10)

### Usage

```bash
# US
python3 ma_scanner.py                   # scan UNIVERSE (161 quality names)
python3 ma_scanner.py --watchlist       # scan WATCHLIST (thesis names awaiting setup)

# India / NSE
python3 ma_scanner_india.py             # scan India UNIVERSE (76 NSE names)
python3 ma_scanner_india.py --watchlist # scan India WATCHLIST
```

### What this scanner is — and is not

This is a **pullback-to-MA scanner in confirmed uptrends**, not a breakout predictor. By the time all levels align, the move has already started — you are buying a pullback in an established trend, not front-running a reversal. That is deliberate. Front-running requires acting before higher timeframes confirm, which conflicts with the hierarchy principle and makes losses harder to survive.

The weekly gate typically reduces the signal count significantly (from 70–80% of tickers to 10–15%). That reduction is the filter working correctly, not a failure.

## Options Spread Universe

`SPREAD_UNIVERSE` in `screener.py` defines which names are liquid enough for vertical spreads. The rule: only spread where bid-ask is tight enough that slippage doesn't eat the edge. Tier 3 is the outer boundary — beyond it, friction works against you before the trade starts.

| Tier | Names | Bid-ask | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Indices** | SPY, QQQ | $0.01 | Tightest on the planet. No binary risk, no earnings gaps. Cleanest spread vehicles. |
| **2 — Mega-cap tech** | NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, META, AMZN, GOOGL, TSLA | $0.01–0.05 | Massive options volume, clean execution. Tier 1 and 2 are where spreads actually work. |
| **3 — Large cap tradeable** | MU, AMD, JPM, GS, NFLX | $0.05–0.15 | Usable outside earnings windows. Needs care on entry/exit. Outer boundary. |
| **Below the line** | Everything else | Wide | Pharma binary risk (VRTX), commodity binary risk (NEM), thin enterprise SaaS (NOW, ADBE, FTNT), mid-caps — slippage consistently eats the edge. |

Names that look like good chart setups but fall below the line (VRTX, NEM, FTNT, ADBE): **good stock, not a spread vehicle.**

## Why This Framework Holds Up

**Quality gate** — the screener filters aren't just revenue growth or price momentum. Debt/EV + operating margin + net margin + ROE + FCF together mean only businesses that can survive a bad year get through. That's the survivability filter. Quality doesn't raise win rate — it makes losses survivable and wins compoundable.

**Structure confirmation** — 4/4 MA alignment means the market agrees with the fundamentals. Price, momentum, and quality all pointing the same direction before anything is acted on. No thesis without structure. No structure without thesis.

**Early warning system** — Special Mention catches names before they qualify. You're not chasing; you're watching the base build. A/D Line and OBV divergence add an extra layer — when smart money starts accumulating before the monthly regime flips, the volume picture changes before the price structure does. When a name finally surfaces in the aligned list, it's not a surprise — it was already on the radar with the volume story already forming.

**Honest watchlist** — every entry has a thesis and a blocker noted. Not just a ticker dump. You know exactly why something isn't in the universe yet and what has to change for it to qualify. The rule: if the blocker is a number, it belongs in the watchlist. If the blocker is the business model, it doesn't.

**Three-tier universe structure:**

| Tier | What it is | Gate to next tier |
|---|---|---|
| `UNIVERSE` | Quality cleared, structure confirmed — core tracked names | Already here |
| `WATCHLIST` | Moat proven, one or two metrics blocking — scanned weekly | Metric clears the filter |
| `FUTURE_RADAR` | Real product, real revenue, path to profit unclear — not scanned | OM turns positive + FCF inflects |
| Removed entirely | Pre-revenue ventures, survival risk, all filters blocking | Not tracked |

Names removed from watchlist in first cleanup: SMR, OKLO, XE (pre-revenue nuclear), IONQ (quantum), CRSP/NTLA/BEAM (gene editing), RXRX/RARE (biopharma), MRNA/BNTX (revenue collapsed), ASTS/LUNR (space ventures). India: OLAELEC (deeply loss-making EV in structurally competitive market). These are interesting themes — not watchlist material.

Names removed from watchlist in second cleanup: PCG (wildfire liability structural, not a metric), FCX (own note said "not a compounder" — cleaner expressions already in universe), SEDG (Chinese competitor share loss is structural, not cyclical), KLAR (credit cycle risk inherent to BNPL model), INOD (AI model efficiency reducing annotation demand is an existential business risk), AMKR (services margin ceiling structural, B-grade at best), CELH (energy drink competitive moat fragile vs Monster/Red Bull), MRAM (TAM too small, speculative angle). Moved to FUTURE_RADAR: CORZ (BTC miner pivot unproven), MOD (B grade, multiple blockers), UPST (credit cycle structural, gate is FCF + converts + through-cycle proof).

**Both markets** — US and India running the same framework. Same discipline, same filters, different universes. The logic doesn't change because the geography does.

**Theme coverage** — semis, AI infrastructure, defense, healthcare, financials, energy, precious metals, solar, space, quantum, materials. Hard to find a major structural theme that isn't tracked somewhere across the 230+ names.

**The one honest gap** — individual position sizing and entry discipline aren't in the framework. The screener tells you *what* and *when the structure is right*, but not *how much*. That's deliberate — this is a framework for finding, not for executing. Execution discipline lives with you, not in the code. A framework that tried to do everything would do nothing well.

The missing layer is mindset — and mindset varies by timeframe:

- **Swing (days to weeks):** structure and momentum are everything. Enter when the coil is tight and CMF confirms. Exit when the structure breaks. No thesis attachment — the trade is the trade.
- **Position (weeks to months):** quality starts to matter more than timing. A name with A+ fundamentals and 4/4 structure can absorb noise. You're riding the trend, not the tick.
- **Long-term (years):** the screener's quality filters become your margin of safety. Low debt, high margins, positive FCF — these aren't just filters, they are the reason a business survives a cycle that kills its competitors. Price paid matters enormously here. Buying quality at a discount to intrinsic value, not at peak enthusiasm, is what separates compounding from hoping.

Margin of safety isn't just a valuation concept — it applies at every level. In sizing: never bet so large that a wrong call breaks you. In timing: wait for structure to confirm before committing, not before. In thesis: always know the one thing that would make you wrong, and watch for it.

Charlie Munger's principles apply here more than any indicator: **common sense** — if the business can't explain how it makes money, neither can the screener. **Rationality** — separate what the price is doing from what the business is doing; they diverge constantly and converge eventually. **Inversion** — don't just ask what could go right; ask what has to *not* go wrong for this to work. **Circle of competence** — track themes you understand well enough to know when the thesis is breaking, not just when the price is.

The screener surfaces the candidates. Common sense and rationality close the gap.

## Dividend Universe

`dividend_plays_for_longterm.py` is a curated list of 57 dividend-paying names filtered for quality: payout ratio, FCF yield, net margin, ROE, debt/EV. Each entry is annotated with the thesis — why it belongs, what the moat is, what to watch. Sectors: financials, energy, industrials, consumer, healthcare, precious metals.

## Automation

`run_aligned.sh` is designed to run via cron on Monday mornings:

```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every Monday at 8am)
0 8 * * 1 /path/to/market-tools/run_aligned.sh

# Or run manually any time
bash run_aligned.sh
```

Log output goes to `/tmp/aligned_cron.log`.

## Setup

Requires **Python 3.9+**. If you don't have Python installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your system package manager (`brew install python` on macOS, `apt install python3` on Linux).

```bash
# Verify your Python version first
python3 --version

# Install the only dependency
pip install yfinance
```

## Usage

```bash
# US dashboard
python dashboard.py                        # CLI only
python dashboard.py --refresh              # force fresh data

## Screener — Quality Filters

### US (`screener.py`)
- Debt/EV ≤ 0.20 · Operating margin ≥ 10% · Net margin ≥ 5%
- ROE ≥ 10% · FCF yield ≥ 0% · P/E ≤ 100x (forward P/E used as fallback)
- FCF gap relief: None allowed when rev growth ≥ 50% AND net margin ≥ 10%
- Grading: A+ ≥ 6pts · A ≥ 4pts · OM weighted at 2pts (primary signal)

### India (`india_screener.py`)
- Debt/EV ≤ 0.20 · Operating margin ≥ 8% · Net margin ≥ 5%
- ROE or ROA ≥ 10% · FCF yield ≥ 0% · P/E ≤ 80x
- FCF gap relief: None allowed when rev growth ≥ 50% AND net margin ≥ 10%
- Grading: A+ ≥ 6pts · A ≥ 4pts · OM weighted at 2pts (primary signal)
- Sector-aware thresholds for Financials and IT

## Dashboard Signals

- **ALIGNED** — price above all 4 MAs (50D, 20W, 10M, 20M)
- **PULLBACK** — above long-term MAs, below short-term (potential entry)
- **AVOID** — below long-term structure

Volume shown as `x(C)` = closed-day vs 20-day avg · `x(P)` = partial intraday

## A Personal Note

I never had success with markets or a successful track record. I never made $100k or a million from trading (or investing) so far in my life. These frameworks were built through failures and learnings — not victories.

They might provide insights, or they might not. They are not tailored advice or suggestions for anyone. They are simply one person's attempt to build a framework for understanding a few themes in the market — quality, structure, momentum, and discipline.

I never found the holy grail. I could never fully resolve the puzzles of the market. I had only learnings. That is what this repository is: a record of those learnings, shared openly in case they are useful to someone else on the same journey.

## These Tools Are a Starting Point

Even when tools work, they rarely work fully for your specific needs. Every investor has a different universe, different themes they follow, different thresholds that make sense for their context.

These screeners cover what came into my radar — the companies I tracked, the sectors I followed, the filters that made sense to me. They will miss things. Many things. That is not a bug — it is the nature of any framework built by one person with one perspective.

If a name matters to you, add it. If a threshold feels wrong for a sector you understand better, change it. If a theme is missing, build it in. The code is simple enough that most customizations take a few lines.

Think of this as a basic scaffold — not a finished house. The value is in bending it to fit your own thinking, your own watchlist, your own sense of what quality means in the industries you follow. More data points, more puzzle pieces. Fewer blind spots.

## SIP Watchlist — US

`SIP_WATCHLIST` in `screener.py` — toll-booth businesses on durable US infrastructure. Not traded. Owned regularly via DCA regardless of short-term price. Common thread: asset-light, fee/royalty/toll income, compound with secular structural growth.

**Financial Market Infrastructure:**

| Name | What it is | Why SIP |
|---|---|---|
| **NDAQ** | Nasdaq, Inc. — exchange + technology + data | Every trade, listing, index product (QQQ pays NDAQ) pays NDAQ; own the exchange not the stocks |
| **MSCI** | Index royalty — MSCI EM, MSCI World, MSCI ACWI | Every ETF tracking these indices pays MSCI forever; purest royalty model in financial markets |
| **MCO** | Moody's — ratings duopoly (~80% global share with S&P) | Every bond issued globally needs a rating; Buffett-proven, near-impossible to displace |
| **SPGI** | S&P Global — S&P 500 licensing + ratings + data | Every SPY/VOO/IVV pays SPGI; combines index royalty + ratings oligopoly |
| **ICE** | Intercontinental Exchange — NYSE + futures + mortgage tech | Toll on NYSE trades + futures contracts + mortgage origination platform |

**Payment Networks:**

| Name | What it is | Why SIP |
|---|---|---|
| **V** | Visa — global card network | Toll on every card transaction globally; no credit risk; cashless transition compounds it |
| **MA** | Mastercard — Visa's global duopoly partner | Same model, slightly more international mix; cross-border fees compound with global commerce |

**Payroll Infrastructure:**

| Name | What it is | Why SIP |
|---|---|---|
| **ADP** | Automatic Data Processing — payroll for millions of US businesses | Extreme switching costs; every new US job = more ADP revenue; already A+ in UNIVERSE |

**Waste Infrastructure:**

| Name | What it is | Why SIP |
|---|---|---|
| **WM** | Waste Management — regulated waste oligopoly | Every community needs waste removed; landfill permit moat; recycling + renewable gas tailwind |

Note: NDAQ ≠ Nasdaq Composite ≠ QQQ. QQQ pays licensing fees *to* NDAQ. Owning NDAQ means owning the company that collects those fees.

## India SIP Watchlist

`SIP_WATCHLIST` in `india_screener.py` — high-quality toll-booth businesses on India's financial system growth. Not traded. Owned regularly via SIP regardless of short-term price.

Common thread: asset-light, fee or infrastructure income, no balance sheet risk, compound directly with India's financial deepening.

**Mutual Fund Infrastructure:**

| Name | What it is | Why SIP |
|---|---|---|
| **HDFCAMC** | HDFC Asset Management — second largest AMC by AUM | Fee income as % of AUM; every SIP rupee in India grows their AUM; financialisation of Indian savings early innings |
| **CAMS** | Computer Age Management — processes ~70% of all India MF transactions | More defensive than any single AMC; wins regardless of which AMC wins; pure infrastructure toll |
| **KFintech** | KFin Technologies — second MF registrar after CAMS (~30% share) | Same model as CAMS, same tailwind; diversified into international fund admin + corporate registry |

**Depository Infrastructure:**

| Name | What it is | Why SIP |
|---|---|---|
| **CDSL** | Central Depository Services — every demat account in India | India adding ~3M demat accounts/month; permanent infrastructure, no structural competition |

**Exchange Infrastructure:**

| Name | What it is | Why SIP |
|---|---|---|
| **BSE** | Bombay Stock Exchange — India's NDAQ analog | Toll on every BSE trade, SME listing, currency derivative; own the exchange not the stocks |
| **MCX** | Multi Commodity Exchange — India's CME analog | Every gold/silver/crude/agri futures trade pays MCX; structural monopoly in commodity derivatives |

**Credit Rating / Data:**

| Name | What it is | Why SIP |
|---|---|---|
| **CRISIL** | India's dominant credit rating agency, S&P Global subsidiary | Every corporate bond needs a rating; SPGI analog for India; regulatory entrenchment permanent |
| **ICRA** | Moody's India subsidiary (~52% Moody's stake) | CRISIL + ICRA = India's rating duopoly, mirrors S&P + Moody's globally; MCO analog for India |

The hierarchy: CAMS owns the road, CDSL owns the parking lot, HDFCAMC owns one of the cars, BSE owns the building — all compound with India's financial deepening.

## Future Vision — The Missing Layer

The framework finds the setup. It cannot tell you how much to size it.

That gap is real and acknowledged. Position sizing is where most losses actually happen — not from wrong stock picks, but from right picks sized incorrectly that get shaken out before the thesis plays out. A 25% drawdown on a 2% position is noise. The same drawdown on a 20% position forces a decision you shouldn't have to make.

The vision: a personal risk profile layer that takes the screener's signal quality as one input and the user's actual financial parameters as another — account size, income stability, time horizon, obligations — and returns a position size that survives the specific drawdown that setup could produce. Not a static conservative/moderate/aggressive bucket. Dynamic: a 4/4 + CMF+ + RS 1.5x + A+ confluence earns more size than a borderline 3/4 setup. The setup quality and the personal risk profile together determine how much.

This is not a feature that can be added with a few lines of code. The reasoning layer is solvable — LLMs can already do this kind of contextual sizing analysis if inputs are structured correctly. What's hard is everything around it: regulatory (personalized sizing guidance in the US touches SEC/FINRA territory), accuracy (people systematically overestimate drawdown tolerance until they're actually in one), and trust (a sizing recommendation is only as good as what the user inputs honestly about their real situation).

Whether this gets built here, somewhere else, or not at all — the gap it would close is real. The screener half works. The survivability half doesn't exist yet at the individual stock level, personalized to who you actually are financially. That combination is where the value is.
