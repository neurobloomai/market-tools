Free, open-source market dashboards and quality stock screeners powered by Yahoo Finance.

## Tools

| File | Market | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `dashboard.py` | 🇺🇸 US | Sector ETF momentum dashboard — MA signals across 50D/20W/10M/20M |
| `india_dashboard.py` | 🇮🇳 India | NSE sector index briefing — same MA framework for Indian markets |
| `screener.py` | 🇺🇸 US | Quality growth screener — low debt, high ROIC, strong margins, FCF |
| `india_screener.py` | 🇮🇳 India | India quality growth screener — NSE universe across key themes |

## Setup

```bash
pip install yfinance
```

## Usage

```bash
# US dashboard
python dashboard.py                        # CLI only
python dashboard.py --refresh              # force fresh data
python dashboard.py --refresh --browser    # refresh + open in browser

# India dashboard
python india_dashboard.py
python india_dashboard.py --refresh
python india_dashboard.py --refresh --browser

# US screener
python screener.py

# India screener
python india_screener.py
```

Both dashboards output a CLI table and save an HTML file locally (`~/market_briefing.html` and `~/india_briefing.html`). Browser launch is opt-in via `--browser`.

## Screener — Quality Filters

### US (`screener.py`)
- Debt/EV ≤ 0.20 · Operating margin ≥ 10% · Net margin ≥ 5%
- ROE ≥ 10% · FCF yield ≥ 0% · P/E ≤ 100x (forward P/E used as fallback)
- FCF gap relief: None allowed when rev growth ≥ 50% AND net margin ≥ 10%
- Grading: A+ ≥ 6pts · A ≥ 4pts · OM weighted at 2pts (primary signal)

### India (`india_screener.py`)
- Debt/EV ≤ 0.20 · Operating margin ≥ 8% · Net margin ≥ 5%
- ROE or ROA ≥ 10% · FCF yield ≥ 0% · P/E ≤ 80x
- FCF gap relief: None allowed when rev growth ≥ 50% AND net margin ≥ 10%
- Grading: A+ ≥ 6pts · A ≥ 4pts · OM weighted at 2pts (primary signal)
- Sector-aware thresholds for Financials and IT

## Dashboard Signals

- **ALIGNED** — price above all 4 MAs (50D, 20W, 10M, 20M)
- **PULLBACK** — above long-term MAs, below short-term (potential entry)
- **AVOID** — below long-term structure

Volume shown as `x(C)` = closed-day vs 20-day avg · `x(P)` = partial intraday

## A Personal Note

I never had success with markets or a successful track record. I never made $100k or a million from trading (or investing) so far in my life. These frameworks were built through failures and learnings — not victories.

They might provide insights, or they might not. They are not tailored advice or suggestions for anyone. They are simply one person's attempt to build a framework for understanding a few themes in the market — quality, structure, momentum, and discipline.

I never found the holy grail. I could never fully resolve the puzzles of the market. I had only learnings. That is what this repository is: a record of those learnings, shared openly in case they are useful to someone else on the same journey.

## These Tools Are a Starting Point

Even when tools work, they rarely work fully for your specific needs. Every investor has a different universe, different themes they follow, different thresholds that make sense for their context.

These screeners cover what came into my radar — the companies I tracked, the sectors I followed, the filters that made sense to me. They will miss things. Many things. That is not a bug — it is the nature of any framework built by one person with one perspective.

If a name matters to you, add it. If a threshold feels wrong for a sector you understand better, change it. If a theme is missing, build it in. The code is simple enough that most customizations take a few lines.

Think of this as a basic scaffold — not a finished house. The value is in bending it to fit your own thinking, your own watchlist, your own sense of what quality means in the industries you follow. More data points, more puzzle pieces. Fewer blind spots.
